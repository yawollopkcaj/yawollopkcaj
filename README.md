I'm an **Engineering Physics** student at the University of British Columbia (UBC) building at the intersection of **Firmware, Robotics, and Custom Silicon**.

Currently:
- Firmware Engineer for **UBC Formula Electric** (UBC's electric race car student design team)
- Currently interested in FPGA's for AI inference on embedded systems

## Cool Projects 

### Neural Accelerator ⬅️ Under Construction 🚧
**Verilog | Python | FPGA**
A custom Systolic Array AI accelerator designed from scratch on a Cyclone V FPGA.
- **Performance:** Achieved ~170x latency reduction vs. CPU baseline.
- **Architecture:** Implemented Google TPU-style matrix multiplication units and a custom Python compiler for INT8 quantization.

### [Robot Summer Project (Autonomous Rescue Robot)](https://github.com/yawollopkcaj/autonomous-pet-rescue-robot)
**C (FreeRTOS) | ESP32 | Computer Vision**
A fully autonomous search-and-rescue robot built from the PCB up.
- **Hardware:** Custom H-bridge motor drivers & power distribution.
- **Software:** Multi-threaded FreeRTOS firmware coordinating with a Raspberry Pi (YOLOv5) via UART.
- **Result:** >95% navigation accuracy in high-noise environments.
- *[Insert that GIF of the robot picking up the "pet"]*

### [Formula Electric Firmware](https://github.com/UBCFormulaElectric/Consolidated-Firmware)
**C++ | STM32 | CAN Bus**
Safety-critical firmware for a 600V electric racing vehicle.
- **Focus:** Battery Management System (BMS).
