## Some Projects I'm Proud Of

* [FPGA-Acceleration for LLMs (newly rennovated!)](https://github.com/yawollopkcaj/FPGA-GTP-Pico-Accelerator):

  _A custom Systolic Array AI accelerator architected on a DE0-CV FPGA with a custom Python compiler for INT8 quantization_

* [Fizz Detective](https://github.com/yawollopkcaj/fizz-detective-portfolio):

  _An autonomous robot software stack (ROS/Gazebo) driven by End-to-End Imitation Learning. Features a hybrid FSM architecture and custom OCR to navigate dynamic urban environments_

* [Robot Summer Project (Autonomous Rescue Robot)](https://github.com/yawollopkcaj/autonomous-pet-rescue-robot):

  _a 3rd place search-and-rescue robot built from scratch, integrating PCBs, bare metal ESP32 firmware with FreeRTOS, and edge-AI computer vision._

* [Formula Electric Firmware](https://github.com/UBCFormulaElectric/Consolidated-Firmware):

  _FreeRTOS firmware for a 600V electric racing vehicle_
